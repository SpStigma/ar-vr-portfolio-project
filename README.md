## Description

Heart of the Totem is my second-year final project at Holberton, specializing in AR/VR, mainly using Unity and C#. This game is a Tower Defense type but with an AR twist. I chose to create a game of this type because I found the challenge interesting; to be honest, Iâ€™m not aware of other games of this kind, which makes this project unique. The goal, like in other Tower Defense games, is to defend your base from waves of enemy hordes until the end.
